# Buisiness Card Scanner

This repository is a tool to extract contact information from business card images. 
The tool provides a simple python API that can perform a business card scan with just few lines of code.
Users might also be interested in the OCR part which is not business card specific 
but is optimized to extract text from scenes with a mixture of text, graphics and non-uniform backgrounds.
We also provide a REST API wrapper built using Django and easily deployable in a single docker container 
which also comes with a demo web app.

## Getting Started

### Install requirements 

### Install BCSanner

### Taking Good Business card images
Images can be taken using a cell phone camera or a scanner. 
For best results, a little of care during the image taking can take you far in term of the final results.
In the case of the scanner, multiple cards can be scanned at the same time provided there is a high contrast between 
the cards and the background (e.g. white cards on a colored background or colored cards on a white background)

### Use the python API


### Deploy and use the REST API
